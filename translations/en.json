It has happened several times that orders were unreadable or incompletely fulfilled. That was not the only problem faced by employees in the back office. Work orders took up to a month to travel to the back office or even got lost. Thus, important data, necessary for issuing invoices, was lost. Problems also occurred during the inspection of repro material. The material was moving from the central warehouse to the mobile warehouses and back without being recorded or marked anywhere. Thus, the material was often lost or stored, and the inventory was a real nightmare. Resource planning was difficult and without the right data it was almost impossible to effectively measure performance.",

In near real time, the service technicians received the work plan and the necessary documentation for the work on their devices. The company placed mandatory fields in the swork orders and thus completely eliminated the number of incompletely fullfiled orders. The company also digitized warehouses, which meant automatic de-booking of material stocks and the possibility of planning working resources. With the completion of the service task in the field, it was returned to the back office in near real time, which accelerated the work process and consequently the cash flow.
